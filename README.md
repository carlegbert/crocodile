# crocodile

Crocodile is a Flask application designed for consuming Github webhooks. I use it as a very simple CI server for a single-page, frontend-only web application which is hosted on a linux server.

## Installing

You probably don't want to install this, since I wrote it mostly for fun/learning. You should use something like travis or concourse instead.

Prerequisites: A linux webserver with Python 3, virtualenv, redis, and a mail client such as postfix.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/carlegbert/crocodile.git
cd crocodile
./create_env
```

Set up a github repository with a webhook that will point to the address of your instance of crocodile. Put the secret you chose in `crocodile/config.py` and edit `crocodile/consumers.yml` so as to consume hooks generated by event types you set up and the branches that you want to watch. You will likely need to set up a web server such as nginx, and then daemonize both gunicorn and celery.
