# crocodile

Crocodile is a Flask application designed for consuming Github webhooks. It is probably best suited as a CI server for a single-page, frontend-only web application. I am building it partly so I can use it for such an application, but mostly for fun/learning.

## Installing

Prerequisites: Python 3, virtualenv, redis
```sh
git clone https://github.com/carlegbert/crocodile.git
cd crocodile
./create_env
```

Set up a github repository with a webhook that will point to the address of your instance of crocodile. Put the secret you chose in `crocodile/config.py` and edit `crocodile/consumers.yml` so as to consume hooks generated by event types you set up and the branches that you want to watch.
